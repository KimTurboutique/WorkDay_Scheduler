# WorkDay_Scheduler
This Work Day Scheduler was designed for Week 5 Bootcamp Challenge. It is designed to help the user organize their busy schedule by adding important events to this daily planner.

I implemented my knowledge of JavaScript, Day JS and Local Storage to add functionality to this webpage with an interactive UI.
